# pros-lvgl
Using an unreleased/unmodified kernel version of PROS (scheduled for release alongside PROS 4), this is a decoupled library version of LVGL 5.3 to go alongside a lvgl decoupled kernel.

## TODO:
- Actually test this with LVGL code.
- Create a project template using this repository.
- Change kernel within project to more updated graphics version if any more updates to the modified kernel are needed down the line.
